## How do I get an animeDB API key?

Go to ‘API Overview’ and select the free version. <br>
Once you have completed all these steps, you will be able to obtain your API key in the ‘X-RapidAPI-Key’ cell.

## Anime search

To choose the type of search, simply click on the drop-down menu above the search bar, which will offer the different types of searches available.
For searches by genre, simply click on the boxes for the desired genres and then click on search to get a list of anime. <br>
For other types of searches, enter the name of the anime, the ID or the rating in the parameter cell to perform the search. If the search does not return any results, a message will be displayed stating that no results were found.
